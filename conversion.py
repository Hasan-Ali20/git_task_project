#First I create 4 variables that have a value stored within them.
#These variables are num1, num2, num3 and string1. 
#These variables are then converted into a integer, float, string.
#So num1 and string1 are casted into integers, num2 casted into float and num3 into a string.
#Then I will print the variables to output the data.

num1 = 99.23
num2 = 23
num3 = 150
string1 = "100"

num1 = int(num1)
num2 = float(num2)
num3 = str(num3)
string1 = int(string1)

print (num1)
print (num2)
print (num3)
print (string1)
